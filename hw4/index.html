<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	
In this project, I created my own rasterizer with various sampling methods and analyzed its efficacy in the context of every method. I was able to understand why some techniques are better from different perspectives like memory and speed. It was also really cool to zoom into the images and play around with different methods and see, in real time, the stark differences.

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and Springs</h2>

In this part, we build a grid of point masses and springs. Both grids should be the given width and height points in row-column form. This means, we loop over the width inside looping over the height and do our calculations there. First, let’s go over adding the masses. We need to check whether this point is in the cloth’s pinned vector, which means the point does not move in the simulation. We do this by looping over the pinned vector and checking if any vector has indices equal to our current coordinates. If there is, then we take note of that with a boolean. Then, depending on whether the orientation of the mesh is horizontal or vertical, we use emplace_back to push the point mass to our list of point masses. In both cases, we multiply the x coordinate by the total width divided by the number of width points. If the orientation is horizontal, we set the y to be 1 and the z coordinate to be the product of the y coordinate by the total height divided by the number of height points. If the orientation is vertical, the previous z coordinate becomes the y coordinate and the new z coordinate becomes a random value between -0.001 and 0.001. To add to the springs, we follow the same looping steps, retrieve the current point mass, and do bounds checking to place the structural, shearing, and bending constraints according to the locations in the spec.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h3>

For changing the spring constant ks, we get a cloth that is more firm and controlled. When the ks is low, the cloth comes down and takes a while to fully rest. As seen in the picture, due to it being less firm, the cloth droops. With a very high ks, the cloth comes down at the same rate but rests significantly quicker because it is firm and does not droop down. The upper edge is straight and does not curve down.

Changing the density yields very similar results to change the spring constant. For a low density, the cloth is firm and settles relatively quickly, whereas for a high density the cloth is much less firm and the cloth takes a while to settle. The rate of the cloth coming down is independent of the density, just like it is for the spring constant. In the case the density is higher, the cloth just has to come down more which is why it takes longer.

Damping turned out to have unique results in which its effect can’t be seen in the final result, but rather in the process. A very low damping rate of ~0.05%, for example, leads to a very quick fall rate of the cloth and it sways back and forth until it finally settles. Another way of describing it is if gravity became more of a nonfactor and the cloth would just oscillate. For a larger damping rate of ~0.67%, the cloth takes much longer to settle and when it does, it does not oscillate back as much. It feels as if something is really weighing it down. Also, when it falls, it’s very smooth, unlike when there’s a lower damping rate, where it looks like there’s some wrinkle effect.

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h3>

As the spring ks value increases, the more firm the cloth becomes, so the quicker it takes to settle on the sphere. When the spring constant is 500, the cloth droops down more and keeps doing so, ultimately taking a while to completely settle. It also fully wraps the sphere before going down. When the spring constant is 5000, the cloth does not droop down nearly as much and also does not wrap around the sphere fully either. However, when comparing it to the example where the spring constant is 50000, the end of the cloth at the bottom does not curve in, but rather hangs out since it's more firm.

For a lower ks value, like when it was equal to 500, we can see the cloth sort of coming into itself and not taking up a whole lot of space. The colors of the cloth are also very intertwined and its more difficult to tell what is where. However, as the ks value increases, such as when it becomes 50,000, the cloth itself appears more like how it would in real life. It takes a more solid shape, lies around, and the parts and colors of the cloth are much more recognizable. Density has similar effects. As we can see, with a low density value of 5 g/cm^2, the cloth is shriveled with similar properties as when the ks value was low and when the density value goes higher to 50 g/cm^2, the cloth stretches out with more distinct properties like when the ks value increased.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

	Pixel sampling is a process used to get the final color for each pixel within an image. We take the work from the previous task and add on to that. To perform texture mapping, you create two new Vector2D objects that contain the passed in texture variables. We take how we calculated barycentric weights in the previous problem and multiply that by our u and v vectors. We take this vector and pass it into one of the sampling methods. 
  Sample nearest works by scaling the texture coordinates by height and width, then rounding the coordinates and getting the texel value. In other words, we get the color that’s closest to the pixel. Sample bilinear works by doing the same procedure but on the four closest texels and lerping the resulting colors. We get the texel of the bottom left, bottom right, top left, and top right and horizontally lerp the to get the top and bottom and finally vertically lerp those two to get the final color.
  Below we compare nearest sampling with bilinear sampling for a sample rate of 1 and 16 for each. The top row shows that with a sample rate of 1, bilinear sampling outperforms nearest sampling. On the left, the colors are more stark and sharp--it has not done such a great job at taking into consideration colors around it. Even when we increase to a sample rate of 16, both images do significantly improve and the quality difference between the two also significantly decreases, bilinear sampling outperforms nearest sampling by still having a smoother blend of pixel colors. So we can see that there is a large difference between the two methods when there’s a stark contrast in colors with a low sample rate.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

Level sampling is the process in which we use mipmapping levels in texture mapping to determine which texel we get. This takes advantage of computing information that is closer with detail and not so much for stuff that’s less relevant, or further. In order to get level, we calculate the log base 2 of the square root of the norms of du and dv with respect to x and y. To obtain these values, we take the inverse system logic from earlier and calculate dx and dy values by adding one to the x and y parameters in different steps and taking the dot product. Finally, we take these new values and dot product them by the u and v vectors that were inputted and subtract them to get the final du/dx, dv/dx, du/dy, dv/dy values.
With regards to speed, pixel sampling is the fastest of the three. By only looking at one point and assigning a color, there is not much work involved. With regards to level sampling and number of samples per level, level sampling is faster because it does not need to look at multiple samples per pixel. With regards to memory usage, once, again, pixel sampling uses the least memory because you just need to store the point and color info. Level sampling has second most memory usage and number of samples per pixel is third because you begin to store more texture information and sample more points per pixel leading to storing significantly more info. With regards to antialiasing power, the number of samples per pixel provides the best results because of how it captures more samples per pixel, such as near edges, then it is level sampling, and finally pixel sampling is last because it is very basic. In conclusion, the number of samples per pixel takes more space and time, but gives us better results.
